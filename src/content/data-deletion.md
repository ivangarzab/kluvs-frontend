## What Gets Deleted

When your account is deleted, the following data is permanently removed:

- Your member profile (name, handle, avatar)
- Your reading statistics (points, books read count)
- Your association with any book clubs
- Your authentication record

## What May Be Retained

The following may be retained after deletion:

- **Discussion records** you created — these are tied to the club, not your account, and may be kept for continuity of other members' experience. They will be anonymized (your name removed).
