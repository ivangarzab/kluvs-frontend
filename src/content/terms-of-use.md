By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

## 1. Description of Service

Kluvs is a cross-platform application and Discord bot designed to help communities manage book clubs, track reading sessions, and monitor member participation. The Service operates in conjunction with third-party platforms, specifically Discord, to facilitate community discussions and club management.

**2.2 Discord Integration:** The Service requires linking to or interacting with a Discord account and/or Discord servers. By integrating Kluvs with a Discord server, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary administrative rights and permissions to do so. 

**2.3 Account Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

## 3. Acceptable Use and Conduct

You agree not to use the Service to:

* Upload, display, or transmit any profile information, avatars, or club data that is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.

We reserve the right to remove any user, delete any club, or restrict access to the Service for violating these rules, at our sole discretion.

## 4. Community Management Features

Kluvs provides features for tracking user reading progress and participation, including public community tracking (such as the "ShameList"). 
* **Club Admins/Owners:** If you hold an "owner" or "admin" role within a Kluvs club, you are responsible for how you use these management and tracking tools.
